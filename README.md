# Networking5
It is a networking project targeting to send files to server. It is a java project having jframe design for user interfaces.
Also there are scopes of improvement. I kept some configuration panels for server side. 
One need to import the project then run the server frame and giving a valid port number will allow it to run a server thread 
and the client will be able to connect to the server through the port number used for server connection
As soon as client connect to server it can start sending files of any size. 
However in the configuration the allowed range of id is given so if the client is using wrong id it can not send files
